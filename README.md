# Avoid_Big_Pick_Small
Final Project "Avoid Big, Pick Small"

Project description : 
    My project is an easy game where you have to move your character to avoid the big ball and eat (or collide) with the small ball by
pressing the “Left” and “Right” arrow keys on your keyboard.

How to install and run the project : 
    1. Clone this git to your computer.
    2. Open the “run_game.py” file in your IDE.
    3. Click run.
    4. The game will start.

Usage :
    Clip of examples of the game https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15AKGKQX0VGqFdSWOb3gqrHwMsjxZna0g?usp=sharing

Project design and implementation :
    UML Class https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uY2nh8U1P_JqhiUHnpYjl__4nNU_oQ63/view?usp=sharing
    class Character is used for creating our character and making our character moves.
    class BigBall is used for creating big balls and making them move.
    class SmallBall is used for creating small balls and making them move.
    class GameRun is used for running the game.
    class GameRun will use the code from the other 3 classes and make them work on our display desktop.
    I modify the guideline code from Aj.Paruj’s github and make them my own version of the ball game.

Rate your project sophistication level :
    I would rate myself about 85%.

Enjoy!!!
